Welcome to Reken, thanks for taking an interest in our project. Looking forward to hear and learn from you. 

Please read the following guidelines for you to determine where and how can you contribute to Reken.

## Types of Contributions we are looking for

* If you find any issues using the Reken runtime, the documentation, the Reken.dev website or playing with the tests, demos or REPL please report it with [issue tracker](https://github.com/hbroek/reken/issues), using the appropriate template.
* For the documentation and website, the project will take pull requests, once the issue is accepted. (hold off sending pull request until then). At the moment the project does not take pull requests for the runtime code, tests and REPL as it a still under development.
* If you have feature requests or ideas for Reken, please file an enhancement request and make sure it is inline with the project's [Vision](./VISION.md) 
* Other contributions like artwork, styling are also considered, either check existing issues requesting these, or file a new issue. Make sure the issue is accepted before providing a pull request.

Note: Reken's philosophy is to have as little dependencies as possible, hence any new dependencies need to have a really good reason to be introduced. 
 
## Contribution rules
* Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project. We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done." Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is correct.
* Open Source Guides are released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
* Please ensure that your contribution passes all tests if you open a pull request. If there are test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your contribution. (note this does not apply yet, but hopefully in the future runtime / designtime / demo / repl pull requests are accepted)
* When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please don't add references or links to things you or your employer have created, as others will do so if they appreciate it. Also review the [Project Vision](./VISION.md)

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [open issues](https://github.com/hbroek/reken/issues) to see whether someone else has raised a similar idea or question.

If you don't see your issue, idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals of this guide, file an issue or enhancement request.

## Setting up your environment

Reken has no run / build time dependencies. You just need an editor and a browser.
