# Reken - Vision

1. Make it easy to create dynamic web pages without manipulating the browser’s DOM directly. 

1. Making a regular HTML document Reken-enabled should be straightforward—no tooling or downloading of resources is required.

1. All Reken functionality is specified as declarative (data-) attribute(s) on the HTML elements it applies to.

1. Reken functionality should support typical dynamic HTML operations: creation, deletion, text changes, attribute modification, styling, classes, and values. It does by attribute-based: assignments, conditions, looping, loaders, routing, and timer definition.

1. Support reuse of dynamic HTML fragments using via components.

1. Provide an easy way to respond to events and update the page state, which should result in an automatic update of the UI.

1. Reken should require no runtime dependencies other than what the browser provides.

1. It should be able to optimize Reken-based web pages on the server by pre-processing and hydration.
