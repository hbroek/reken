# Chapter 10: Resources

In this chapter, we'll explore the various resources available for Reken, including demos, the Reken REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop), and community support. These resources are valuable for developers who want to learn, experiment, and get help with Reken.

## 10.1 Reken Demos

Reken provides a collection of [demos](https://www.reken.dev/demo/index.html) that showcase its capabilities and help you understand how to use it in practice. These demos are practical examples for creating dynamic web pages, interactive forms, and other Raken applications. You can access these demos to see Reken in action and gain insights into its features. You can find the demos on the [Reken.dev](https://reken.dev) website under the link [Demos](https://www.reken.dev/demo/index.html)

## 10.2 Reken REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop)

The [Reken REPL](https://www.reken.dev/repl/repl.html) is an interactive environment that allows you to experiment with Reken code in real time. It's a powerful tool for learning and testing Reken features, attributes, and expressions. It comes with a number of existing snippets that you can tweak, and you also can use the REPL to write and execute your Reken code snippets. The REPL allows you to see the results immediately and explore different use cases. It's particularly useful for trying new ideas and getting hands-on experience with Reken. The REPL can also be found on the [Reken.dev](https://reken.dev) under [REPL](https://www.reken.dev/repl/repl.html)

## 10.3 Community and Support

One of the strengths of any open-source project is its community. Reken has a growing community of developers, designers, and users passionate about the framework. Here's how you can engage with the Reken community:

### GitHub Repository

The official [Reken GitHub repository](https://github.com/hbroek/reken) is valuable for accessing the framework's source code, contributing to its development, and reporting issues or bugs. If you encounter problems or have suggestions for improvements, the GitHub repository is the place to engage with the core development team and the broader Reken community.

### Documentation

Always refer to the official Reken documentation for in-depth information on how to use the framework. The documentation provides explains Reken attributes, features, and best practices. It's a comprehensive resource for both beginners and experienced developers. On the [Reken.dev](https://reken.dev) website you will find a [Readme](https://www.reken.dev/dist/README.html) and this [Reken Developer Guide](https://www.reken.dev/dist/documentation/developer-guide/toc.html).

### Tutorials and Blog Posts

Watch for tutorials and blog posts created by the Reken community. These resources often offer step-by-step guides, tips, and real-world examples to help you become proficient with Reken. Henry van den Broek, the Reken Maintainer, has a [blog](https://blog.henryvandenbroek.com/), where he also occasionally [blogs about Reken](https://blog.henryvandenbroek.com/tag/tech/) and specifically the applications he creates based on Reken.

### Application Gallery

To get a feel of the applications you can build with Reken, check out the [blog](https://blog.henryvandenbroek.com/tag/tech/) mentioned in the previous section. Also [Reken.dev](https://reken.dev) has a list of applications built with Reken.

Of course, there is the almost mandatory [TodoMVC reference implementation](https://www.henryvandenbroek.com/apps/reken-todomvc/index.html) that every self-respecting Web framework has implemented.

You can also find the [2022 Advent of Javascript coding challenge](https://hbroek.github.io/AOJ-Reken/), with 24 different little mini-apps. All the sources for these mini-apps are available on [github](https://github.com/hbroek/AOJ-Reken).

On the Reken website, you can also find released applications (games, utilities, learning tools) that are live on the web; some of them are also available as applications on the [Apple App store](https://apps.apple.com/us/developer/henry-van-den-broek/id1083257041) and the [Google Play store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8814357367682609687).
