## 9.1 Common Questions and Answers

### Q1: What is Reken, and how does it differ from other JavaScript frameworks?

**A1:** Reken is a lightweight library for creating dynamic web pages using HTML, CSS, and a sprinkling of JavaScript. It stands out from other JavaScript frameworks by focusing on simplicity and ease of use. Unlike more complex frameworks like React or Angular, Reken allows you to work with standard HTML and only requires minimal JavaScript code. It's an excellent choice for developers who want to add interactivity to their web pages without the learning curve of a full-fledged framework.

### Q2: Is Reken suitable for building complex web applications?

**A2:** Reken is best suited for projects where simplicity and ease of development are essential. While it can be used to create dynamic and interactive web applications, it may not provide all the advanced features and optimizations of larger full-stack frameworks.

### Q3: Can I use Reken with other JavaScript libraries or frameworks?

**A3:** It depends, Reken can be used alongside other JavaScript libraries. Reken however does require that none of the DOM elements or its descendant that have Reken attributes are changed.

## 9.2 Troubleshooting Tips

### Issue: My dynamic content isn't updating as expected.

**Solution:** Ensure that you've correctly set up Reken attributes on the HTML elements you want to make dynamic. Double-check the expressions and values used in the attributes, and ensure they're updating as intended in your JavaScript code. You can use browser developer tools to inspect the DOM and see if the attributes are applied correctly. Or use the console to check it there are any errors.

### Issue: I'm encountering errors when working with REST API calls.

**Solution:** When using Reken for REST API calls, check the following:
- Ensure that the REST endpoint URL is correctly formatted and accessible.
- Double-check your REST call syntax, including the variable names and object properties.
- Handle errors gracefully by implementing error-checking and error messages in your code.

### Issue: My Reken components are not rendering as expected.

**Solution:** When working with components, ensure that you've defined them correctly using the `data-component` attribute in a `template` element and that the component's HTML and JavaScript code are structured appropriately. Check for any console errors that may provide insights into the issue.

### Issue: My web page is not responding as expected to user input.

**Solution:** If you're having trouble with user input, review your event listeners and their associated functions. Ensure that your JavaScript code for handling user interactions is correctly linked to Reken attributes such as `data-value` or `data-on-`.
